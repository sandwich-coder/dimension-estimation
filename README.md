# dimension-estimation


#### Description

This is a high-dimensional extension of the previous work 'CubeDimAE'. The problem of the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional datasets, MNIST for example, being measured to be all zeros, has been mitigated by aligning the axes with the principal components to stabilize the connections. Whether the new results are correct is to be verified, and it seems to require building more advanced models.

Also the iterative scanning, where multiple grid widths are tested, is eliminated as redundant.
