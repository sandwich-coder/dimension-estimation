# dimension-estimation

## Introduction
This is a high-dimensional extension of the previous work 'CubeDimAE'. The problem of the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional datasets, MNIST for example, being measured to be all zeros, has been mitigated by aligning the axes with the principal components to stabilize the connections.
